AI-ML Assignment
  
Dt – 19/10/2022
  
Below are the steps involved in the assignment:
  
Please create a virtual environment and install all the dependences libraries mentioned in the requirements.txt 
 
<a align = "left"> 1.	Imported the required libraries
  
<a align = "left">2.	Loaded the dataset
  
<a align = "left">3.	Did the required statistical analysis to understand the dataset better
  
<a align = "left">4.	Define a function to do all the required pre processing before vectorizing the required the column
  
<a align = "left">5	In the defined function the following we have done:

  i)	removed unwanted symbols,
  
  ii)	tokenization, 
  
  iii)	removed stop words, 
  
  iv)	removed numbers, 
  
  v)	stemming, 
  
  vi)	positional tagging, 
  
  vii)	lemmatization.

<a align = "left">6	Applied the pre-processing function on the synopsis column.
  
<a align = "left">7	We have used 	synopsis column as independent variable
  
<a align = "left">8	We have used genre column as dependent variable
  
<a align = "left">9	Then we have built a pipeline to classify the genre
  
<a align = "left">10	We have use the TFIDF vectorizer 
  
<a align = "left">11	We have used the Multinomial Naïve Bayes Algorithm for classification
  
<a align = "left">12	Them we have find out the accuracy score in classification
  
<a align = "left">13	For rating prediction, we have used synopsis as the independent variable.
  
<a align = "left">14	We have used the rating as the dependent variable
  
<a align = "left">15	Then we have built a pipeline to predict the rating
  
<a align = "left">16	We have use the TFIDF vectorizer again
  
<a align = "left">17	We have used the KNN regressor Algorithm for regression.
  
<a align = "left">18	Them we have find our the r2 value in regression.
